# üéØ Tracklytics
**Streamlit-Based Object Tracking & Speed Estimation App using OpenCV**

Tracklytics is a lightweight, interactive web application that allows users to track objects in a video feed and estimate their speed using OpenCV and Python. The interface is built with Streamlit to provide a user-friendly dashboard experience with real-time feedback.

## üß™ How It Works

1. Load a video or access your webcam.
2. Select a region of interest (ROI) for tracking.
3. App uses OpenCV to detect and track objects across frames.
4. Speed is estimated based on movement across frames and time intervals.
5. Final output includes tracking path, speed metrics, and downloadable video.
